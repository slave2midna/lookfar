Hello and welcome to Lookfar! A GM Toolkit for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). This module is for [Fabula Ultima](https://www.needgames.it/fabula-ultima-en/) by [Need Games](https://www.needgames.it/). It is designed to make running games easier and more efficient for solo players and game masters. It provides several tools for quick and efficient generation of loot, dungeons, and encounters. It also offers a means of handling travel checks, and rare equipment crafting on the fly.

This module is a WIP and can change at any time. It requires the [Project FU](https://github.com/League-of-Fabulous-Developers/FoundryVTT-Fabula-Ultima) Fabula Ultima system (v4.0+), and is actively in development for Foundry v13. New features are not supported for Foundry v12 or any earlier version of PFU.
